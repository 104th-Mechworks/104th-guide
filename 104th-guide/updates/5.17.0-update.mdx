Changes to Ranks and Aerial Qualification<br />
Update from the Art Team

<!-- truncate -->

## **Art Team Update**
A few days ago the Senior Art Team met and sat down for a review of a few different art-related topics. <br />
We talked about a few big things we wanted to push towards, tinker with and change in the future.

The big topic of discussion was **green visors** which used to be universally used by all Aerials. <br />
With that, we decided it was fitting and time to bring it back. Along with a few minor changes to the Aerial Qual.

## Aerial Qualification Updates

### Aerial Trial Cross-Platform Unification
Aspects of the Aerial trials have been unified across all three platforms. Check out the kmc for [more information](https://discord.com/channels/1198467309979832400/1198467310680281188/1299869971626856458)<br />
Upon passing phase 2 of the qualification, aerial candidates of all consoles will complete their trials in the Shadow Company Server, the new hub for the Aerial Qualification.

### Return of the Green Visor
This is a big one many of you have asked for. **Effective immediately,** troopers that have passed the Aerial Trial will be issued **a green visor** to signify their qualification.<br />
The visor will be added to your current helmet regardless of helmet type or other qualifications. Wearing the green visor will be *mandatory*.

### Art team will distribute visors to all current active aerials
**Please note:**<br />
- All aerial troopers that are active in a platoon get the green visor.
- If you are currently holding the Aerial qualification, you do not need to request it, art team will reach out to you shortly.
- you will *only* receive the green visor. No other alterations will be made to your helmet. Any additional changes need to be requested as usual.
- The distribution may take up to 10 days (because Art Team has a life). If you haven't received your helmet by Nov. 14th, reach out to [WO Odd CT-28823]

For any questions, reach out in [Helmet Decal Questions](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1204750540223942726)

============================
## **Minor Rank Administrative Move About**
A few minor changes have happened to the 104th rank structure to stream line some of the ranks and what they are equivlant to.<br />
This is very much "administrative power". Meaning what moderator permissions, chats, and clearance people have within the main server.<br />
Most noticeably is the RCSGT and RCCPL being moved into the higher officer chat to give the commando pipeline some more representatives within the higher echelons of the 104th.

Check the graph bellow.<br />

More updates will be releasing throughout the month.
