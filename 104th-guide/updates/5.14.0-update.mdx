### Run Down
The 104th is moving into summer with haste!<br />
With that officer have met a few days ago to plan how we want summer to go.

Originally we were planning to do a big operation before summer staff break however we have opted to delay until after the break to make sure what we have planned is clean and polished.

#### Summer Event
Instead we will have a week of games via a short campaign event, each day will have an objective. Complete the objective and be rewarded. Fail and face the consequences.

An announcement about the Summer event will be announced right after this.

#### Staff Break
0 Requirements, go enjoy summer, feel free to continue to raid and play as a group.<br />
But people wont be required.

#### Pre-Op Week
Requirements are back for a week to get people back into the swing of things and getting ready for the next 104th Operation.

#### 104th Operation
The end of August will have our next 104th Operation. More details to be annonuced during the summer break.

Happy summer, any questions about staff break
