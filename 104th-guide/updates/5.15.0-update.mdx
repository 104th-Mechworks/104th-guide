Summer Event announcement

# Update 5.1.5
## 104th Summer Event
### Introduction
The 104th have one final week until we will call our annual staff break.
This staff break will remove hosting and attendance requirements. Those around may continue to gather and raid, while others take this time to enjoy time away.

To wind down to the staff break we are running a **week long campaign event** (this is not an operation just abit of fun).

**Each Day this week** there will be a challenge for the unit to work **together as a collective** to complete. If the challenge is complete the unit will be given a reward. If the challenge is not competed there will be a deficit for the following day.

Each challenge will be announced via: [operation-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1257829003675308083)<br />
