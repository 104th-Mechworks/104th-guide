Another minor unit update to improve the quality-of-life of the unit.

A rather minor one, but worth announcing a drawing attention to.

# Update 5.02

## Strike System and Updated Rules
### Rules Update
Inside of [104th-rules-and-info](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198378556804300802) there has been a new category of rules which highlight the new standards of maturity across the unit. It highlights that BFII is rated 16+ so as much as we allow younger members. The community and milsim especially will be looking to maintain a certain standard regarding behaviour and maturity

#### **Maturity and Consequence**
- BFII is rated a 16+, we expect all members of the community to act accordingly.
- Along with being aware the majority of members are adults. We expect a good level of maturity.
- Individuals who are deemed as too imature for this milsim will be swiftly removed.
- This unit operates as a close group. We do not have time for internal conflict, toxic behaviour or drama.
- If you do end up being involved in any such situations: Discipline will be strict and simple.
- Upon too many issues you will be spoken to and either removed or demoted down to CT to be re-trained.

This is a more simple version of the one we have added to the **104th staff rules**.
These sets of rules will hopefully ensure the 104th maintains a good and enjoyable standard. And minimise drama.

### Strike System
To pair with the updated Maturity and Consequences rules.
The 104th is drawing a fresh line and slate and any past conflict and drama. This has been particularly mentioned towards staff in some recent staff announcements.
However i am inviting the entire community to join in on this **fresh slate**. To ensure we continue to enjoy the incredible community we have hear without being dragged down and bound to situations of the past.

With that: All current individuals holding
<span style={{ color: "#000000", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Strike I</span>, <span style={{ color: "Black", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Strike II</span> and <span style={{ color: "black", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Strike III</span> are going to be reset.
Strikes will continue to be given out for minor disturbances. All major issues will now be handled through removal.


## Command Staff update
Over the last few days there has been some changes to
<span style={{ color: "#f1c40f", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Command Staff</span>:

<span style={{ color: "#f1c40f", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Battalion Commander</span> and
<span style={{ color: "#1447f0", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Commodore</span> as heads of the two major Venators.<br />
**The Resilient** - Army Command<br />
**The Triumphant** - Starfighter Command<br />
They have both been invited to be apart of the 104th Fleet Command.
So Fleet Command is now: MCDR, SCDR, MCPO, BCDR, COM. [Server Admins]

Then inside the 104th Command we have added the
<span style={{ color: "#f009c9", fontWeight: "bold" }}>ARC Captain</span>
role.
So the heads of each Special forces Troop has a larger voice and weight inside of the overarching direction of the 104th moving forward. Alongside the
<span style={{ color: "#f1c40f", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Battalion Commander</span> and
<span style={{ color: "#1447f0", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Commodore</span>

### KMC Update
Finally a small update.
The KMC, the 104th qualfication training server has now added in all advanced trainings to all be hosted centrally within the server.
This is to streamline the hosting of these trials, now that the trails are open for all members of the Army to go for.


Any question regarding the changes use [question-and-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198460745361395722)

At ease,<br />
