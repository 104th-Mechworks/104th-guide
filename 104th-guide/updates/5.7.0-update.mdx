## Sinkers Meeting - 3rd of February

On Saturday Sinker hosted a meeting which he used to rant about his dislike of the 104th, ban certain members and antagonise and frustrate others.
Where he started it off by banning both AT Sixten and AT Katana for stating they are happy on Battlefront and didn't like/want to go to Arma.
Bellow is a few comments made throughout the meeting to show you the general major comments made. I also have the entire 4 hours transcript and recorded for those who wish to get the full context. However it doesnt help much if at all.
The following are some statement from the meeting from Sinker:

----
- "I'm not apologising for the meme" - Sinker not apologising for scaring many members and staff about joking about deleting the entire 104th server.
- "No I'm not returning to the 104th" - yet coming back to host a unit update just to complain, frustrate and piss off 100s of members of the 104th server.
- "Imagine loosing access to the account that owns all Platoons and the entire milsim" - just reminding everyone that he is the individual in control, and can do as he likes.
- "I'm not back im just cleaning house" - admitting to coming back just to remove and do what he wants.
- "Im going to have a bunch of people messaging me (about being angry), but i don't care" - admitting to not caring about the opinions of the community.
- "We aren't waiting for battlefront to die, its already dead" - admitting to not caring about the continued love for the game.
- "Because I am all about proving everything wrong you've done in command staff." - trying to indicate that Command Staff have been against the community, putting words in Commands Mouth.

**Moose**: (Unmuted his mic, didn't even speak.)<br />
**Sinker**: Moose i swear to god don't make me have to server mute you<br />
*pulling power on when Moose hadn't even spoken yet. *<br />

----
**Rain**: Is this all coming across much more argumentative then it may be needs to be.<br />
**Sinker**: Good<br />

----
**Sinker**: No i didn't hand the milsim over to dark, I just put dark as MCDR, i own it, i own all your Platoon servers too.<br />
**Rain**: Is this not a community milsim?<br />
**Sinker**: No.<br />

----
**Thinker**: You may have build the foundations, however the community built the walls and the roof and lived in it.<br />
**Sinker**: No.<br />

----
**Mako**: If you want people to like you and support you, you gotta do things that wont cause them to not like you in the future.<br />
**Sinker**: I don't want people to like me. Im not asking people to be my friend.<br />

----
**Rain**: You've just got people abit worried.<br />
**Sinker**: They should be.<br />

----
**Sinker**: I have Dark running the 104th<br />
**Rain**: It doesn't seem like it right now.<br />
**Sinker**: Well he ran it for three months.<br />
*This personally frustrated myself, undermining myself when ever he fancies*<br />

----
**Sinker**: A revolution wont work because then i'll just...<br />
*never finished his sentence but we can all guess what he will have said*<br />

----
**Sinker**: I don't know why you are acting surprised, if you know me enough you should not be suprised. Ive done what ive done. Or try telling me to do something different.<br />

----
**Sinker**: I know I generally haven't done anything wrong.<br />

----
**Barrage**: What benefit do you get out of keeping ownership of this Server.<br />
**Sinker**: because I would like to have this as something I have made.<br />
**Thinker**: So to be blunt, is this for your ego.<br />
**Sinker**: Yes.<br />
... a few back and forths.<br />
**Sinker**: Im not expecting people to like me, I'm not trying to sit here and reconnect friends or not burn bridges.<br />

----
**Sinker**: I will generally never give up ownership of the discord, so not point trying to convince me.<br />

## The Fallout of the Meeting, a vote of No Confidence.
After 5 years of loyal service to this Milsim and working under Sinker. I have made the decision that i have had enough of the un-predictable, immature, sporadic and careless behaviour that Sinker has brought to this unit.
And the risk and uncertainty that his ownership brings.
This was the breaking point.

After the meeting concluded i met with pretty much all members of Command Staff and Captains of the 104th. In which we have all voted **a vote of no confidence in Sinkers leadership and ownership of the 104th Battalion Milsim**
Because of this we are implementing a contingency. We cannot get ownership off him and we don't expect to. He is the owner.

So as a result **the entire 104th 100+ Officer Team has met and created a complete duplicate of the 104th to continue on.**. Every chat, Every Role. And as many messaged as practically possible.

**The 104th Command and Officer Team has decided to leave this server and Sinker to continue the 104th in a Server owned and ran by myself, MCDR Dark, as i hope i have earnt everyone's respect instead of demanding and forcing it.**
**We invite you all to move and transfer over to this NEW 104th Server to CONTINUE your experience inside of the 104th. All 2LT+ has been spoken to before this action was made and in support. **

All Platoons, Main Servers, Trails, logs, Art and more has been copied over and saved.

We wish to keep this great unit united and together. And have all members move in support of us. We are not forcing you, simply informing all members of what we as officers are doing.
And that we no longer wish to support the careless behaviour of the owner who has joked and threatened the potential future of this group.

We will be hosting multiple meetings to hear out everyone and explain everything in complete detail in the coming days.

**JOIN BELOW TO ENTER WHERE THE 104TH WILL BE CONTINUING.**
**THIS IS YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE.**
**IF YOU ARE UNSURE JOIN TO ASK QUESTIONS AND SPEAK TO THE OFFICER TEAM**

I hope people understand.<br />
This unfortunately is no meme, or joke. <br />
This is for real. <br />

The 104th Command Staff have lost confidence and faith in Sinker as the owner. <br />
And as a result have carried out this contingency to hopefully salvage the situation. <br />

Sinker cannot see this chat on his main account, so we hope this message will get out to people before this is deleted. <br />
Reach out to any 2LT+ to ask question. DM me, DM anyone and we will hear you out and explain. <br />

Attempt to leave this out of global comms and other chats. <br />
DM people. <br />
