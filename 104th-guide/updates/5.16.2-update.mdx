This is the second part of many for the release of update 5.16.<br />
This is a small update regarding ARF and AT-RT.

These have been changes talked about between myself and CPT Electrik (Head of 60th Recon Battalion and ARF Program).<br />
And we wish to introduce and a collective update.

# Update 5.2 - part two.

## AT-RT is now open to all.
  ‚Ä¢ You must be a current ARF in Active Service to attend.<br />
  ‚Ä¢ This is a change due to the closing of Royalty Platoon.

Royalty Platoon, the PC Platoon of Rancor Battalion, is closing down due to key foundations within its trooper and staffing ranks stepping down. It is a shame to see this long lasting platoon go, however apart of the journey of the 104th is seeing unit go, and the remaining staff of such units finding new friends and homes in other places.

With that some core fundamentals of the ARF and AT-RT Qualifications have had to be re-evaluated.

With that, ARF has already previously been open to all to go for.<br />
Along with the Advanced Qualification above ARF, AT-RT.<br />
The reasoning is clear, to move the qualification more inline with the rest of the core infantry qualifications. Along with giving greater opportunities within the unit to progress.

**This is going to be released across all 3 devices.**<br />
All ARF and AT-RT members will continue to be assigned and work within Loth Platoon. The unit within 60th recon which acts as the Cadre over all ARF/AT-RT Training.<br />
60th Recon are still the overseeing unit of the program across all devices.


### Updated Requirements:

#### Old reqs
  ‚Ä¢ Phase 1: Cap 5 points as an AT-RT<br />
  ‚Ä¢ Phase 2: Get a kill streak of 30 as an AT-RT<br />
  ‚Ä¢ Phase 3: Top 3 in team<br />

#### New AT-RT REQS
*Using AT-RT only*<br />
  ‚Ä¢ Phase 1: top 3 on the team<br />
  ‚Ä¢ Phase 2:  5.0 K/D with 50 elims<br />
  ‚Ä¢ Phase 3: 1700 SPM<br />

Additional information on these new Reqs will be announced within Rancor in the next few days along with a few minor adjustments if necessary.

## Medic with ARF.

Some people were asking how Medic works with ARF.

Officers who are ARF will be able to earn the medic qual. Giving them access to the S-5.

CT-CPL ARFs will not be able to earn medic. And stays the same as usual.

For SGT+<br />
ARF + Medic + Aerial<br />
ARF + Medic
