# Update 5.2 - part one.

## Introduction
Hello all, hope everyone is well. @everyone

This is the first part of many for the release of update 5.2.<br />
This has been an update that has been worked on for a little while with lots of changes to increase engagement across the board.

Throughout the weekend a few big announcement will be placed out with changes to the future of the unit. <br />
To hopefully bring new ways of playing with the group.

Enjoy the read. <br />
*First up - The Medic Qualification.*

## Medic Qualification!
### What is the Medic Qualification
This has been a Qualification in which people have been talking about and wanting for many years. And within the last 6 months the officer team has been looking to release. <br />

This Qualification is different.<br />
It is focused on 2 phases of teaching. Before having both trial testing and field testing. Field testing is something has is not really done at all apart from Advanced Rifleman Trials. <br />
Field testing is the idea of simply having people play in live raid games. And the instructor will assess you and expect you to play appropriately to your role within the raid.

Additionally, it is opening a new weapon to officers. The S5. As originally the officer class was reserved to just them.

Along with giving all lower Enlisted and NCOs an entirely new class in which many will not have played much of.<br />
So enjoy the officer class. We must stress there are clauses in the assessment to stress that this is a **support class** and all trials have been created in that mind frame.

### What are the Requirements
Find all information about how to earn it in the KMC!

### Who can earn it
- Infantry and Starfighter in Active Service. (Platoon or Wing)

### In game Reward
- CT-CPL (Medic Qualified) = Shiny Officer Skin + Officer Class
- PO-FCPT (Medic Qualified) = Naval Officer + Officer Class
- SGT-BCDR (Medic Certified) = 104th Officer Skin + S5 Weapon
- FCPT-COM (Medic Certified) = Naval Officer + S5 Weapon

### Cosmetic Reward
- Medic Patch on Helmet in Red.

### Im currently SGT+ and have been playing officer, is that changing?
- All current officers can continue with the class! But may not use the S-5 until gone through the qual. This is a reward for your service as always.
- SGTs can now use the 104th officer skin instead of shiny. Makes the group looks cohesive and distinguishes Enlisted Medics.


### How it works with other Classes
#### CT-CPL (PO-FCPT)
- Medic is Considered a Base Class Qual.
- You cannot go for any other Base Class Qualification while having Medic (Rifleman, Anti-Armour, Marksman, ARF) (not counting SFC quals)
- You can obtain Aerial + Advanced Aerial at the same time as Medic.
- You continue to hold your base class. (Assault, Heavy, Specialist)
- You cannot go for Advanced Classes. (apart from Advanced Aerial)

**E.g:**<br />
__Assault__
- Assault + Medic + Advanced Aerial
- Assault + Medic + Aerial
- Assault + Medic

__Heavy__
- Heavy + Medic + Advanced Aerial
- Heavy + Medic + Aerial
- Heavy + Medic

__Specialist__
- Specialist + Medic + Advanced Aerial
- Specialist + Medic + Aerial
- Specialist + Medic

*Are the acceptable combinations*

### FCPT-COM
- The same as PO-FCPT but you can also earn the S5

### SGT-BCDR
- For Officers it is considered an additional certification (as Officers can already play officer, they will just earn S-5 instead)
- You CAN go for any other Base Class Qualification while having Medic (Rifleman, Anti-Armour, Marksman, ARF)
- You CAN obtain Aerial and Advanced Aerial at the same time as Medic.
- You CANNOT go for Advanced Base classes (apart from Advanced Aerial)

**E.g; (all previous combinations plus the below)**
__Rifleman__
- Rifleman + Medic + Advanced Aerial
- Rifleman + Medic + Aerial
- Rifleman + Medic

__Anti-Armour__
- Anti-Armour + Medic + Advanced Aerial
- Anti-Armour + Medic + Aerial
- Anti-Armour + Medic

__Marksman__
- Marksman + Medic + Advanced Aerial
- Marksman + Medic + Aerial
- Marksman + Medic

*Are the acceptable combinations*
