This update is quiet a big one to announce a few major changes to the 104th Command Staff.
All these changes are effective immediately, or have already been implemented.

The hope is that these changes will ensure the group continues to push forward with strong leadership oversees all corners of the 104th!

## Command Restructure Update

### Special Forces Headquarters Update
Special Forces has came to myself and have been wanting to make some changes to there ARC Chain headquarters structure.
To allow for a more clear chain of command for those inside of Special Forces, along with those interested in joining the unit in the future.

**The past the command structure:**
- CDR Fox - Head of SF
- ACPT Mako - A Troop Lead
- ACPT Jesse - B Troop Lead
- ACPT Vanok - C Troop Lead

With there own ALTs and ASGTs under each respective troop.<br />
Each Troop represents the collection of Special Forces member on the respective consoles.

The change that has been discussed internally within SF and with myself directly is the following:
- Bring a singular ACDR back as Head of the ARC Program.
- Have 2 AMAJs as Executives of the ARC program.
- Move ACPT back down out of command and have them just be troop commanders.
- Not to bring back AGEN because it was too confusing and convoluted. AMAJ will make a clearer progression structure and understand of indepenent roles.

**The point: **the current issue is there is no direct chain of command or figure capable of making executive decisions over the program to push it forward.<br />
This has not been the case since ACDR Goliath, which was many many moons ago.

Overall, the SF command staff members will not change simply the ranks and positioning, and opens new progression for the lower ARCs to progress upwards.<br />

Myself and Fox cleared SF to hold internal voting after we cleared the restructuring decision.<br />
All members of Special Forces could vote out of the 3 current ACPTs as to who would be voted as head of the program and more senior to take up ACDR.<br />
The other 2 individuals would take up the AMAJ roles and act as their seconds.

**The result: **<br />
Mako-16<br />
Vanok-13<br />
Jesse-4<br />
A close set of voting with Mako being voted as the overseeing head of the ARC Program.<br />
As usual, CDR Fox remains the Head of Special forces looking over both ARC and RC programs.

**ACDR: **
Holds the same responsibility and power as the CDRs of the Army.<br />
The head of the ARC Program. Final say under the CDR on changes to the program and admissions.

**AMAJ: **
Holds the same responsibility and power as the MAJs of the Army.<br />
The second in Commands of the ARC program. Able to complete all jobs if the the ACDR is unavailable. And preside over any jobs delegated by the ACDR.

**Promotions**
ACPT Mako > ACDR<br />
ACPT Vanok > AMAJ<br />
ACPT Jesse > AMAJ<br />
Big Congratulations to **ACDR Mako ARC-4804**  **AMAJ Vanok ARC-15346**  **AMAJ Jesse A-43**<br />

### New Commander
Another big Command promotion and change.

**MAJ Trig**  will be moving up to Commander.

Trig has been inside of the 104th and serving as Major of PC for 3 years. Since January 2021.
In this time he has grown massively to be one of the most consistent members of Command staff. And in his time of leadership has overseen many projects and supported and expanded the 104th massively with his work. Along with running PC with a strong, fun and fair iron fist.

With that i am happy to announce he will be moving up to be taking up additional responsibilities, along with being rewarded for the additional work he already does.

BCDR Warpath is head of the Army.<br />
CDR Shatterstorm is executive of the Army.<br />

CDR Trig will be taking up my responsibilities as Commander of the Vanguard.<br />
The Vanguard is the 4th ship of the 104th Fleet.<br />

The Resilient - Lead by BCDR Warpath<br />
The Triumphant - Starfighter Corps Ship - Lead by COM Rain<br />
The Ravager - SOF Ship - Lead by CDR Fox<br />
The Vanguard - Intelligence, Records and Security Ship - Lead by CDR Trig.<br />

The Vanguard is the hub of many additional teams and projects of the 104th:
- Art Team
- Administration Team
- 3rd Party
Along with many other minor teams.<br />
When i was CDR my responsibility was to oversee and ensure all of these additional structures that help the 104th run properly worked well.<br />
These responsibilities will be being passed off to Trig, who has been forever running it all along side me since he first became a desert trooper back at 2LT in 2020.<br />
Along with Trig's additional continued responsibilities in media, merch and helmet security.

This promotions allows Trig to hand over the reigns of running PC to someone new. And focus on all the rest of the areas he now oversees.<br />
And allows me to hand such responsibilies over to him, so i can step back and manage the "bigger picture" of the 104th.<br />

Any questions feel free to ping either of us.
Big congratulations to **CDR Trig**

### New Head of PC
With that, time to announce the new head of PC.

**MAJ Tuut** will be moving to be the new head of PC.

Tuut has been staff in the 104th since 2021 and in this time has had a tremendous impact on the 104th.
Primarily being the fun, jolly, and slightly drunk leader of Fang Platoon. And doing an incredible job in building up and keeping my own original platoon a great place.
Additionally Tuut has had a huge impact in leading Vanguard Company as a LT and CPT.
Throughout his time within PC command he has always had an active opinion and voice in pushing PC forward. Going out of his way to organise meetings within the officer team and officer raid without being prompted.
I have also had the honour of meeting Tuut irl and hes a properly lad.

Im sure all of PC will agree that he will be great in continuing to lead PC forward into the future.

He will continue to oversee and lead Vanguard Company until CDR Trig has returned from his small holiday to America where the two of them will look to select the next CPT of Vanguard.

Big love and congratulations to MAJ Tuut CT-12860


## Additional Notices
### May the 4th
On May the 4th the 104th will be releasing and sending out a link to a t-spring merch store with a small selection of caps, hoodies and other items.
These are all **0%** profit, the 104th gets no monetary funding or value from the sale of this merch.

However we have decided it would be fun to allow members of the 104th if they wishes to, get a nice cap or hoodie or t-shirt.
More information will release on May 4th.
Along with hopefully more items in the future if this goes well and @trig can set it up.
