## New Rank / CPO Changes.
The first of a few potential changes/additions being discussed at the Officer Level.

Upon reviewing the current rank structure we have decided to make a new change.

**MCPO AND CPO REMOVAL**
MCPO and CPO are going to be being removed.
This is because both ranks have became rather redundant. Along with a bag stigma around both ranks as ranks without much major purpose.
With that we will be looking to **remaster** the CPO rank into a more diverse and useful roll. **Warrant Officer**

**NEW SENIOR NCO RANK**
### Warrant Officer Rank [WO].
- Remove MCPO/CPO - both roles have been pretty much redundant. And i wish to change the CPO role into something more expansive. Bad stigma on them. And tied down to being seen as "the discipline guys".
- Add a new NCO rank, this would work similar to CPO, but with more opportunity. Essentially it will be a Rank that can be given to senior members of the group who hold areas of responsibility, but not as a commissioned officer [2LT+] with activity and "mass leadership expectation". Such as leading a platoon or company.
- The role would act similar to the CDR role, but on a lower level. Essentially will have as much power as their position holds. Eg. CDR Fox is head of special forces, has command of all of SF, CDR Shatterstorm is executive of Army, when i was CDR i had responsibilities to run Admin, Art Team, other niche responsibilities as well.
- Warrant Officers would have as much power as their position gives. There are many areas of responsibility at Battalion and Company level, which will vary from each Warrant Officer.

### Example of Warrant Officer responsibilities:
__**NCO TEAM LEADS: **__
- **Head of Discipline**, Jaws would continue with his suspended/ban appeal responsibilities of the Senior NCO of it.
- **Head of Admin**, Uchiha would continue with leading and managing all documents and admin team.
- **Head of Logistics/Records**, Ollie would be given responsibilities with overseeing certain server-side maintenance.
*Additional role appointments can be given and held by members of this Rank.*

__**SENIOR NCOS: **__
- **Company NCO**, certain staff may move into a "Company NCO" position, where they hold administrative power over a lot of the core documents and running's of the Company under the Captain and Lieutenant. Could still hold Platoon position, but the senior enlisted member of the Company.
- **Senior NCO**, certain staff may move into a "Senior NCO" position, more ambiguous but given to NCOs who are not looking to peruse up the Commissioned Officer tree but sit above as a highly respected member of staff.(example could be Vinh)
Essentially, the role would be used to allow versatility within the ranks, similar to how the CPO rank was, but without the misconceptions of just being "the discipline guy".

### Additional Notes:
- This Rank would be allowed to continue to peruse special forces, as they are non-crucial.
- This Rank would not have as high in game activities, or core leadership responsibilities. But obviously cannot be not present at all. Tasks must be properly completed.
- This Rank would not be able to be a CO or XO position. They can be SNCOs, SLs, PNCOs, CNCOs, or Platoon-less (with command approval).
- Reason for the above, is because they are not meant to be a core officer/leader. They are an NCO, but can do work on higher levels (such as the Battalion or Company level). As an administrator and guide.
- This Rank would be expected to stay in the role for quiet a while 6 months + (this is not a stepping stone to 2LT). However in time can move up. Abit like how Plutarch has done, was a CSGM for a long time, then has moved up to 2LT and XO.
- Warrant Officer sits *slightly* above SGM, below 2LT.


### Current Warrant Officer Appointments.
- CPO Jaws > Warrant Officer
- NCDR Uchiha > Warrant Officer
- CPL Ollie > Warrant Officer

additional may come in the future.<br />
Give all 3 of these guys a huge congratulations, all 3 do a HUGE amount of behind the scenes work for the group.


## 104th Projects
New Channel [104th-projects](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1208095825155334224) has been added to the server.
This channel is an Advertisement channel to official 104th sponsored servers.

**Not all of these project are owned and ran by the 104th, however projects we associate ourselves with and support**

If you get removed from these projects, it does not guarantee your removal from the 104th. <br />
And the same for if you get removed from the 104th it does not guarantee your removal from the project. <br />
*This very much depends on the reason for your removal*

The hope is through this chat we can hopefully franchise the 104th onto other games in a **non-forced manner**. <br />
I must stress, i do not have the time or resources to run each of these servers, if they do not take off, or die is reliant on those who put work on such projects. I will simply advise and support.

all new projects will be named using the "104th" name. <br />
However older projects will not change (Operation Skira or Operation Hades). <br />
In time, i wish to reach out to Sinker and advertise the Arma Reforger group he was building.

**104th Galactic Sim**
A new 104th project to set up a dedicated group on Squads - Galactic Contention - Mod. This is PC only. <br />
Originally Skira was going to do this, but that has developed into a Vanilla Squad group.

**104th Quick Reaction Force**
A small Ready or Not group ran by Trig, not too formal and fancy, but worth allowing people to use if they wish.

There are small talks about something related to Halo as well. <br />
However the details ect are very new, and will take a few months potentially.

:::warning
Not all of these are ran by the 104th. Just projects i personally support and happy to see the 104th involved around.

I do not have the capabilities to lead each of these sub groups. If they fail that is on their own accord.

I will not be making a sub discord for every single game. That will just get silly, but i do wish to franchise to some other games.

## Battlefront Remastered.
So we have all seen the news.
Battlefront 2 2005 is coming out for all consoles.
Including 64 player online multiplayer. This is huge, and if the star wars community give it attention and love, it will show how many individuals care and want another Battlefront.
So we will be doing a MONTH LONG OPERATION. Attendance on Battlefront 2 2005 will count towards raid attendance. And there will be roles set up to accomodate stuff being ran. We will probably write up some simple raid-rules for the game as well so we can be a proper clone group.

There is no comments on if it will be cross platform. So will keep you updated on that. <br />

I hope to also get some good media on it. <br />
As right now the entire star wars community it talking about it.

See you on the Battlefront. <br />
*You need to buy the new classic collection, even if you owned the previous Battlefront 2 classic*


That is all, Thankyou. Any questions go and use [question-and-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198460745361395722)<br />
Cheers everyone<br />
