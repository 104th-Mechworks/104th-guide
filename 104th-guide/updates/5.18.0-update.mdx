## Pixel Helmet Event
I hope everyone enjoyed last weeks fun pixel helmet event. **Ecks** did a great job in making these helmets that its been great to see everyone have a laugh and some fun regarding it all. Please can people look to remove the Pixel helmets as the event is now over.

## **Christmas Calendar**
With the year coming to the end there are a few things up and coming. Including the Christmas Calendar and break.

__Bellow are some key events and dates. __
- **1st December-6th of January** - Christmas helmets and festive server.
- **6th December - 15th December** - Operation Kâ€™ragala (a fun and simple Operation to get people on as a build up to Christmas)
- **16th December - 6th January** - Christmas Break (3 weeks)(no raid requirements, go have time with loved ones.)
- **January 2nd** - Update 6.1 - New years update.

Any questions regarding this Calendar please ask the officer team.

Christmas break will be from December 16th to Jan 6th about 3 weeks. No raids regs or any other activity requirements will go on.  Enjoy the time off with family and friends.  When we return the whole unit will sync raid cycles and things will begin again.

## **Christmas Helmets**
It is that time of you again for Christmas helmets!

Get your Santa hats out boys! From now until the end of the Christmas break all users can go and add a Christmas hat to there helmets. Along with Rifleman being able to equip a santa hood. So go have fun with it. Do not attempt to push these boundaries, but some stuff will be sent out to allow people to equip a hat.
