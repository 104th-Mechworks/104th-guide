Hello everyone, this is the final instalment of the 5.2 update in which i have been releasing over the weekend.<br />
Hopefully these changes will be positive and ensure continued strong engagement, enjoyment and fun for the entire unit.<br />

There have been many other minor changes, new additions and suggestions brought to me by the officer team over the last few months.<br />
So rest assured that there is still more to come.<br />
We will be looking to do a big event/operation around Christmas. We were talking about doing one in Summer, then Halloween but for maximum engagement the world-wide Christmas/new year break seems like it is the most fitting for the unit.

Additionally i will be looking to a big sit down with Officers in the coming week or so to hopefully generate some more ideas for the future to continue to give support towards all those continuing to love Battlefront, along with supporting all the amazing projects in [104th-projects](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1210713345825574934)

Now onto part 4 of changes - the Starfighter Corps!

# Update 5.2 - part four.

## New Command Staff Member!
It is with much honour and joy i introduce you to the latest member of Command Staff.

## GCPT Snips > Air Captain.
**CPT Snips CT-22-690** has been a huge asset to the Starfighter Corps for many many years. And over the most recent months has been stepping up to support all 3 consoles in leadership, advise, sortie organising. Along with many plans and aspirations for future Starfighter Events. Snips has been the Executive of the Owls for a very long time. And before then apart of the beloved Sparrows.

She has been work incredibly hard and is why myself and **COM Rain CT-9266** are so confident in giving this Promotion to her.<br />
As Air Captain she will be working closely with Rain, myself and the rest of Command to continue to lead the 104th as a whole, in particular the Starfighter Corps.

**Give her a huge congratulations!**

## Honorable Mention
It would also feel wrong to not mention **WCDR Moody CT-15788**  who has been working incredibly hard alongside Snips to run Xbox Starfighter so solidely and incredibly. The both of them are a power duo and were both contenders. WCDR Moody is a strong and tested leader and will continue to Command the Owls. While Snips with all 3 consoles will be doing more outreach towards the entire Corps.<br />
Big commendations to Moody.

## Base Class Changes.
This a big one. And maybe slightly controversial however some thing in which i discussed with a large amount of Officers to give me confidence in releasing and doing. I believe it will have some positive effects on raid attendance and open some more opportunities. While hopefully not divulging to far from the structure and foundation we have had for years.

__Each Member of the 104th will be able to Select a base Infantry AND base Starfighter Class__
- **Each member of Army** can select a base Starfighter Class which they can use in Sorties. (Starfighter Assault games only).
- **Each member of Starfighter** can select a base Infantry Class which they can use in Raids. (CS, GA, Blast).
- Each member will need to be given a BRANCH role. This branch role will let you move up and progress through that branch.
  - <span style={{ color: "#e7e7e7", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Branch: Army Battalion</span> Can join an Infantry Platoon, Get Infantry Qualifications, Go for SF, Where Infantry Helmets.
  - <span style={{ color: "#a3d7e2", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Branch: Starfighter Corps</span> Can join a Starfighter Wing, Get Starfighter Qualifications, Go for Ace Pilot, Where Pilot Helmets.

### What this means
- It means that Army members will have more choice in Starfighter games, giving them more choice. (i personally love the V-Wing). Which will hopefully boost sortie numbers.
- It means that Starfighter members will have more choice in Army games, giving them more choice. And hopefully boost Raid numbers and bring more engagement.

### Why?
- A few Platoons within the Army have taken upon themselves to organise unofficial "platoon-sorties" where they will play any Starfighter Class. As they cannot do so within the main 104th Sortie System. We sat down with these Platoons and discussed the idea on how we can allow them to continue to enjoy there enjoyment of other game modes, while continuing to support the Starfighter Corps Staff and Sorties. Instead of imitating rules privately.
- There has always been an ask of the Starfighter Corps to get a little bit more leeway and access, and with the current state of the game and community. I believe it is the appropriate time to give leeway without jeopardising the current foundations of the group. While keeping the primary goal of maximising enjoyment, engagement and fun for the entire group.

### How to get your other base class
Please go to the Channel and Roles channel at hte top of the discord now. And select your branch and what you want for your other base class. (for army or starfighter). <br />
Please do NOT try and change your current base class. We will be watching audit log and see!
