## Art and Media Update
Hello @everyone  hope you are all doing well.

A few days back the 104th art team gathered for quiet a big meeting where we discussed alot of art/appearance/helmet topics.
So spending this announcement mainly just communicating some things we have done or talked about.

## New Outwards Appearance.
For along time i have wanted to make some changes to ensure the outward appearance of the 104th is more noticeable and engaging.
With that, we have made alot of active effort over the last week to develop some more ways to show off the 104th in a more public light.

This has included:
- Creating a new 104th Logo
- Updating Social Media Accounts (youtube, website, instagram, tiktok).
- Begin Development of more of social media presence.
- Begin Development of 2 104th Trailers (one more like an action montage, one more informative)
- Begin Development of a Uniformed look for NEW Company Patches/Icons. And uniforming/improving/updating current Platoon patches/Icons. (More on this in the future)

**I am happy to present the new 104th logo**
This icon will be the new face of the group, going back to the OG 104th wolf with some edits. Thankyou to  **NLT Odd CT-28823**  for creating it.

## Helmet Request Bay
**The helmet request bay is open.** Before you go requesting anything, __read this entire announcement carefully__.

First things first:
- **All pending helmet requests that were put in, in the old main server need to be re-requested**. Please make sure to check the requirements, check the proof, and stick to the format to ensure an efficient process. Look out for your CTs to make sure nobody is forgotten.

Due to the move, **some Designs/Decal requirements have changed** to account for lost messages or servers.
- The old welcome chat is backed up.  If you are unable to verify your join-date for the Loyalty-Designs, you may take it up your chain of command to acquire proof.
- If you are struggling to find sufficient proof for a design, reach out to your staff. In some cases, having a staff member vouch for you will be accepted as proof. DO NOT ABUSE THIS to your advantage.
- The message requirement for *Fangs of Dedication*  as well as the raid requirements for *Clanker Buster*, *Mark of Brotherhood*, *Battle Hardened*, and *Leadership Commendation* have been lowered considerably.
- The google doc has been updated with these changes. Consult it to check each designs requirement. You can find it in the pinned message in here and in the resilient.

**Please note that the whole point of these Designs is to reward your effort and dedication inside of this milsim. The requirements are not meant to be easy. They will not be altered for your personal comfort. If you want to earn something - earn it.**

## Helmet Customisation Changes
### Aerial Troopers
- Aerials have two customisation routes:
 - Route 1: Standard Infantry customisation system with a chevron.
 - Route 2: Using green visor, they must use a given set "Aerial Helmet", however we are expanding the customisation on this route.

- For the Green Visor Aerial Version:
 - Cadre: *Complex Custom Helmet, with green visor*
 - SGM+ : ***Simple** Custom Helmet, with green visor*
 - LCPL-SGT: *Mastery Design **AND** Platoon Legacy Design **AND** 1 Design/Decal.
 - CT:  *Mastery Design **OR** Platoon Legacy Design **AND** 1 Decal*
*We have increased the amount of customisation Aerials using the green visor can get*<br />
*Still less than the non-green visor, but more*<br />
*The bottom image showcases how the Aerial with Mastery Decals look*

### Advanced Trooper
- For Scout Helmet, Airborne Helmets, Reg ARFs, Reg ATRT, Bacara:
 - Head Cadre: *Large amount of personal customisation.*
 - Cadre: *Medium level of personal customisation.*
 - SGM+: *Small level of personal customisation.*
 - Instructor: *CT-SGT + 1 section of personal customisation.*
 - CT-SGT: *2 Decals + Platoon Legacy Design*
*We have increased the amount of customisation Advanced Troopers can get*
