==================================================

Hello @everyone  hope you are all doing well.

_**60th decals and arf**_

On top of Update 5.1 where we spoke about the Art team meeting, It is finally time for the<br />
<span style={{ color: "#4a9797", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Rancor Battalion, 60th Recon Company</span> get some customisation like the rest of us. the Art team have worked hard to make the decals fit the 60th Unique helmet designs and i feel they have done this phenomenally so well done to all those involved The parameters for these are below.

### Trooper Customisation.
All Troopers can earn decals and design to there helmet through progressing through the unit.<br />
This will create a unique look, you can update your helmet every 4-6 months due to the work is takes to update.<br />
- SGM+/PO1+/SL+: some customisation similar to advanced helmets
- SGT/PO2/FCPT: 4 Designs + 1 Decal
- CPL/LCPL/FL/FO/PO3: 3 designs + 1 decal
- CT/PO: 2 designs + 1 decal
- Difference between design and decal.
- Decal = Smaller Symbols
- Design = Bigger painted aspects

_**Social Media**_

Touching on the social media, the Instagram activity has been amazing with lots of engagement with posts as well as Story's. Tiktok is slowly getting there so as many of you that can support please do. Clip of the week has been a huge success and will e continuing with the next Clip submission being Friday. The social media is something i have personally taken over and will be continuing to grow our reach. dont forget to use the thread to share your clips and cinematic shots to get them featured on the social media.

==================================================

_**Merch**_

The merch is something else i have been working on in the shadows and will be releasing summer 24 date **TBD**. It is something i know alot of you are wanting and when its ready an announcement will be released. The merch is completely none profit meaning the price u pay is what the printing company charge for the item. So no command staff are not making money.
