## Ban Appeals
With everything that has happened there has been a large amount of people who have reached out to attempt to appeal bans.
Old Friends, Old Enemies etc.

With that, myself and **WO Jaws CT-12051** have sat down and updated the Ban Appeal Process, to streamline the system.
Obviously everyone reading this isnt banned, but i know some of you may have people who you know wish to appeal.

If this is the case, direct them to the KMC or **WO Jaws CT-12051**. From there they can ask to appeal their 104th ban.
This does not mean we are opening the flood gates, many who have been banned will stay banned. However there are some we are happy to see return.

We just accepted our first batch. Out of 12 appeals, 4 got accepted.
However we still wish to be fair and just and give everyone the opportunity to appeal.

## Events and Media
Not too much to mention, however want to touch base. The next updates will include more.

Right now we are setting up 2 teams. An events team, and a Media Team.

**Events team** will be hoping to plan and run some more PvP, 20vs20, Tournaments and other battlefront 2 related events.
Additionally looking over other community based or other games options. Keep eyes at the top of the discord in the events area. We are hoping to use the discord events area much more.

**Media team** will be hoping to set up more media for the 104th. Establishing many things we have wanted for a while, Tiktok, High Quality youtube vids, developed website. Ect.
This will continue to support growth int this community.

**Come join me tomorrow at 10am GMT (yes early oh no) for my Bad Batch Watch Party, im sure someone else will run one later in the day as well. **

==================================================
## Other Games
[other-games](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1208095825155334224) have been set up to allow people to talk, discuss and look for groups on other games to play and enjoy together.
Definitely go check out the new section and get involved!

Especially the [Helldivers 2](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1208105710806892564) forum chat ðŸ˜‰

Additionally, there are currently a few different discussions on how the 104th can continue to franchise itself onto other games.

I am potentially looking to set up the **104th Galactic Sim** on the Squad Galactic Contentions Mod - however this is still just a concept being discussed in [PC](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198378557613805688) i have made it clear i dont have the time to lead, however will support the idea.

Along with potential talks of looking into sponsoring and supporting a Halo group. (more details in the coming weeks).
Stay tuned.

## 104th Road Map
I did have a teaser that i was going to announce regarding some current topics of discussion inside of the Officer Chat.
As a few days ago we met to talk about Battlefront and stuff we can do going forward.
Im not going to release the teaser yet, maybe in one of the updates in the coming weeks.

However know the Officers have met and there are quiet a few ideas and concepts being thrown around - in very early stages.
Will share more soon.


That is all, Thankyou. Any questions go and use [question-and-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198460745361395722)

At ease,<br />
