Christmas Update

<!-- truncate -->


### Christmas Break is now in full effect
__Christmas Break times__
**Monday 18th December 2023 - Sunday January 7th 2024**

In this time there is no activity requirements for any troopers or staff. Go enjoy yourselves and spend time with friends and family.<br />
Then join us back on Monday the 8th where stuff will kick back up. Obviously, if you do wish to raid, play and talk feel free.

### Christmas Cosmetics.
**For the duration of the Christmas Break the 104th will have a few server changes to get everyone in the festive mood. **
- Server Chats and Categories will get a festive Spice up.
- All individuals may add  festive emotes to their names. 🎅🏻🤶🏻🌨️❄️☃️⛄️🍪🦌🎄🎁🌟⛄
- LT+ may take a more Christmassy name (try and make it link to your name and be punny)
- All members are going to be allowed a Christmas hat on there helmet. @vinh6999 has also got a cool Christmas rifleman hood 😉

Now, this last point of adding hats has been asked for alot. As everyone performed nicely in the Operation im going to give it a chance.<br />
If you can add it to yourself without it looking shit go for it. <br />
Or politely ask a member of the art team to sort it, but they dont want to be spending Christmas adding hats to 800 helmets. <br />
DONT be sharing round helmets. <br />
*feel free to use the hat bellow*

### Enjoy the Break.
Many have been working hard over the last few months. <br />
So do remember to take time and go and get off discord and spend time with family.

See you in 2024!
