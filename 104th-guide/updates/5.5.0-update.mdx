## Debrief
Congratulations to all those who have participated in the Operation over the last 2 weeks.
Hopefully people have enjoyed the event and found the experience fun and enjoyable.

The point of the Operation was to hopefully bring abit of fresh air to the game experiencing maps, modes and factions that we dont always play as often. It wasn't design to be super serious, but instead good fun for the Christmas season.
I believe overall, the operation has been a success in completing this main point and objective.

There were some minor issues of some misunderstanding of the rules or keeping track of wins. However all got smoothed out very quickly thankyou to the help of **SCDR Warpath CT-5384** and each team of officers that look over each Company.
In addition when teams did meet in the field all Company vs Company games have been reported back to have been intense, enjoyable and well played. So very good work there as well.

I understand some of the smaller units did struggle to get some members on, in the future i will work to hopefully a design an Operation which can bring a greater involvement to smaller groups as well.
