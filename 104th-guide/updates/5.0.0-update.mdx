## General Update

Attention, Everyone<br />
Welcome all, bringing this chat back to be the place for formal announcements moving forward.

I have been given trust and confidence by MCDR Sinker to return as the new MCDR of the 104th.
I will be overseeing and in charge of the entire BFII Division of the 104th.
With that, i ask for those with question or queries to use the official [question-and-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198460745361395722) channel. Instead of the use of my private DMs.

The 104th will be continuing as usual, and for the majority of the unit you will be very little change within the operations of the unit.
As in reality, the CPTs, LTs, 2LTs and SGMs are the true team who work to provide the experience that all who come here look for. ❤️
Command staff are just here to support and give experience and vision from our years of service.

I am however also looking to update a few things, as can hopefully be noticed with some areas of the discord becoming more streamlined over the next few days.
I have already implemented a few changes to the 104th Staff Doctrine and Rules to hopefully also prevent any further internal conflict within this unit.

All 104th Platoon Servers has been transferred ownership to the [United Solar Command](https://discod.com/users/402785029756944415) account which is accessible to Sinker as he is still the official 104th Owner of the entire group and its projects.
