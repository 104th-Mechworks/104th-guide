In 3 days, where the Sun wakes, the King of the Ocean's weapon grows a new spike.

Hailing from Dawn Platoon, **PVT Indoline RC-5-28/371** has managed to graduate from the Republic Commando Programme. <br />
After months of training and hardships, he has finally made it through, joining his brothers in Triton Squad. <br />

Let's congratulate him for his dedication and hard work in [global-comms](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198378557253099598)
