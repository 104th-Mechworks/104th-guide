New Commandos
A very exciting announcement to write,
We have 3 new Commandos to the unit.

<!-- truncate -->

**PVT Indoline RC-5-28/371** who was previously announced last week.

Along with **PVT Oiler RC-5-34/808** and **PVT Cadaver RC-5-34/703** who are joining the PC Commandos!<br />
This is a huge and exciting moment for the 104th to finally have a strong Squad of Commandos per Console. All of them have been working very hard for this moment of a collection of years.

So i would like everyone to take the moment to give love to all of our Commandos for the hard work, dedication and time they have put in to have this moment happen.

I will have my bias to PC as its old Commander and say it is great to see a strong PC Component finally. And i couldnt ask for finer individuals for the role.
