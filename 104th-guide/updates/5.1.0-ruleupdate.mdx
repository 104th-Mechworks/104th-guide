Rule updates for the 104th

<!-- truncate -->

# Update 5.01
*Repost from a few days ago.*


## Forward
Attention, everyone<br />
With the unit now operating across multiple games.
There has been a lot of conversation and discussion regarding the relaxing of certain rules and expectations.

Key ones that have already been implemented are regarding the necessary activity to maintain in the active 104th unit.
This update will be informing all on the new standards regarding 104th class and qualifications.


**Please read this with care. All changes are effective immediately.**
## The changes
 - Army Members can go for all Army Qualifications no matter the company.
 - Army Members can go for all Advanced Army Quals. You must have the stage 1 qual first to attend the stage 2 trial.
 - Army Members may go for Instructor roles for any qual no matter what company they are in. (as long as the cadre is happy to have them as an instructor)
- There is no longer a limit of the amount of advanced troopers per Platoon Vs Base qual. I want to see as many advanced troopers as possible from who can meet the requirements.
## Clarification
- The rule still stands that you can only be 1 advanced qual + aerial.
- The rule still stands that you can only be Advanced Aerial + 1 base qual.
- The rule still stands you must drop the current qualification before attending another. You must also hold that qual for a substantial amount of time before trying to change route. (No qual hopping).
- Army Qualifications are: Aerial, Marksman, Rifleman, Anti-Armour. (ARF is not changing, it’s still in discussion. Rancor is not changing.)
## Why are these changes happening?
There has been a large amount of requests to be able to have greater freedom in the exploration of classes and advanced classes.

The “specialised company” concept has been pretty successful with many Platoons gathering a large cadre of individuals who have trained together to earn themselves certain classes. Best example being Fang and Storm Platoon with the number of Riflemen they earnt together and have then displayed themselves in raids.

However, admittedly some platoons were unable to adapt and evolve into the system that was implemented to grow a Platoon and Company dedicated to a certain play style and craft. So we are reverting back to open the field so all Companies act as standard Infantry. Platoon or Company Command can still push there companies to continue to hold the “Assault” “Armoured” “Mechanised” or “Marksman” Company formations if they wish. But it will not be being enforced by command staff.

Example: When I first created Shadow Company in 2019 I only recruited Assaults and Heavies. And trained my Company to act as more heavy hitting 2 Assault + 2 Heavy fireteams.
But that would be up to the CPTs and LTs decisions (which I doubt will occur).

There will also be a review coming of all Qualification standards, which may have some adjustment to reflect the current gameplay of the game. (Attempt to negate any RNG). But this will be in a few months time if it occurs.

Thankyou all for reading.

Any question regarding the changes I will be answering in [question-and-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/1198378556137410660/1198460745361395722)
