These duties encompass deep knowledge of regulations, understanding of rank and position, and operational leadership during simulated activities. Below is an exploration of these duties:

- Training and Raid/Sortie Leadership: Proficiency in conducting training sessions and leading raids/sorties in a professional manner from start to finish, including planning, execution, and post-action reporting is crucial.

### Communication and Mentorship
- **Effective Communication:** The SGM/SL should know where to direct questions about common topics like class and name changes, and how to articulate the functions and requirements of different platoon structures and squads.

### Daily and Weekly Responsibilities

- **Visibility and Mentorship:** Maintaining a presence in voice chats to reinforce their approachability and mentorship, and reporting to higher command to keep them informed of platoon status.

### Behavioral Expectations
- **Discord and In-Game Leadership:** As a role model, the SGM/SL is expected to foster the development of junior members, replicating successful leadership traits and maintaining discipline during MilSim operations.
- **Platoon/Wing/Squadron Leadership:** Active participation in platoon/wing/squadron command decisions if in the position, ensuring optimal performance of squads, and fostering relationships through consistent communication and support.
