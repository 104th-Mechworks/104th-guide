## Battalion Commander Report
Working on getting Army Command Cohesion to a higher standard.
Each console is running separately, however, we all share similar problems. (Manpower, lack of leaders to name a few.)
Regardless, we are here with each other to help build an environment where people can have fun.

## Xbox Console Commander Report
Working with CPTs and LTs of xbox to find out what our goals are for the coming months.
Continuing to monitor staff with the strike system, Releasing the MVP in Raids for CTs to earn and a specific way to log them.
Xbox seems to be doing relatively well with some luls in activity here and there but that is to be expected with the game age other than that business as usual.

### Ares Company Report
Majority of staff are meeting the requirements
that were set out within the resilient some have needed more of a push than others that mainly being between SGT - 2LT LCPLs and CPLs have been putting themselves out there to get raids done and meet their reqs some have fallen short due to people not being around when they are
(need to encourage SGT+ to try and reach out to said individuals and see if they can help them find another ares staff member that better fits their times) The company needs more praise from its leads 2LT - CPT yes we say we appreciate them but we dont this very often and it shows as some staff can lose their way and feel unseen because we are neglecting the fact they are the backbone of this company no matter their rank we wouldn't be in the position we are without them Howler: Low attendance from CT's as of recent many have put in LOA/NFFCs which has added to this but staff are working to try encourage their CTs to make sure they're meeting there attendance Communication between has slowed due to not much happening with the game or community they are being active and getting involved within chats just not much happening within the staff chats themselves

#### Taurus Platoon
CT's and staff alike bar a few seem to be stagnant with their progress only really coming alive to answer the question of the day which seems to be a morale boost that is helping within their platoon (may be worth encouraging their command to get the other staff involved with doing them) Staff seem to be a bit isolated many don't know where they want to end up leading to them not putting in as much effort either due to past issues or ongoing ones this may be down to their own isolation or not enough communication between the command team and their staff members leading to them feeling isolated from the CoC (This also applies to Scrapper) The command team is constantly communicating with eachother on different matters that come up which they have learned to improve on from the former command teams which has shown they have grown a lot as a trio

#### Scrapper Platoon
Many of their staff are active but some of he higher ranking members dont seem to be around much due to various reasons (command team mainly) leading to unneeded stress being placed upon the other staff around them that have to fill in for them or leading to fighting as less communication is occuring as a result of this lack of presence from members of the staff team Cough is working hard to keep the platoon alive even if it means making hard choices like steppin people down however in some cases she has caught backlash for things she has decided to do this is not entirely on her I believe being more open with her team and explaining her thought process could help to better the already good bonds she has within the platoon The squads are active but ghost in perticular is struggling this is both the CT and staffs fault this is because the staff cant do much else if the CTs aren't willing to become active again but they always could've worked to fix it sooner instead of letting it get to the point it is at only starting to get better after yourself (Dymphna) joined as an FTL and were able to bring a breathe of fresh air back into the platoon

### Havoc Company Report
Company is doing fine, thankfully. There haven't been any major issues that’ve required severe action but we do need to sit down with a few staff to discuss individual points. As mentioned above in the commander’s section, activity continues to be a bit of a problem but I know this rings true across the battalion. We  recently held a promotion ceremony/meeting that went well and had a decent amount of people in attendance. Hopefully with the summer holidays coming up for those members still in education, we will see a good rise in activity and new members joining.


## Playstation Console Commander Report
I finally get to say I am the new kid on the block :)  It has been an eventful first couple days.  Handled some business that should have been dealt with in the past imo.  I am looking forward to introducing what I believe is a new style of leadership to playstation.  I want to be more open, have more communication, and be more collaborative in nature.   To that end, I would also love to work closer with my partners in crime in the other consoles too, in order to really get on the same page.  I will do my best to avoid isolation of the console or of the companies.   I have so far had great vcs with many people both in here and in my console.   I had to deal with some stuff that distracted me from my main goal this last weekend.  I want to do deeper dives into all platoons on the console to address any issues and hopefully handle some problems before they become major problems.   I am hoping as well to talk to as many as I can from CRs up, to very much get a grounds up view of what they see and what can be improved.  To that end I am employing people like Camtwo to help me with that.  I want to know how the troopers feel, their morale, and even what their perspectives have to offer.  The next time we have this report I am sure I will have much more to say (yeah fr).  For now I am very much looking forward to digging in and making the best possible outcome for the console and the battalion as a whole. To everyone I have chatted with so far, I am looking at getting a bulk deal on ear plugs to make my speeches less painful in the future.

### Monarch Company Report
I am really excited about the opportunity to lead Monarch as its Captain. I have some really strong ideas that I am keen to implement but want all of these to be built on a foundation of mutual respect, cooperation and communication. I am keen to foster a stakeholder mentality across the Company and build on the already strong ties between its two Platoons.
Initial priorities will be to establish a structured operating rhythm, setting out a meeting calendar so that there is a clear understanding of what is happening within each Platoon and an opportunity for us to share best practice and resolve common issues. I am also keen to ensure that we have a routine that not only allows leadership across the Company to be visible and seen as relatable and approachable but also use these opportunities to reenforce the importance of having strong core values and culture in both Platoons.
I am looking at seeing where we can create consistency in our approaches, in how we deal with admin, strikes, issues and structure. I am also keen to pool resources where possible to create greater opportunities for engagement (Especially across Raids, admin, events and the media team) I really do think that some of what goes on in the Platoons can be maximised at a Company level. I am wanting us to be a trailblazing Platoon, not afraid to try new things and look at how we continue to evolve our proposition. What do we need to do to keep our people wanting to log back in every day and how do we fill our staff roles with purpose and a feeling of adding value.
Ultimately though, I want Monarch to be a fun, happy, safe and active place to be. If we get that right, everyone’s lives will be a lot easier.
First course of action will be to schedule some meetings, formulate a plan and a road map of actions and then work collectively on activities based on 2 month phases. I have already begun work on what this will look like but  am keen for it to be ‘our’ plan and not mine so I will spend time understanding and listening to what the Company staff need. I plan to have this plan executed by the CSGM so that I can use the CoC as effectively as possible

### Valkyrie Company Report
Redreb and Garmr have helped out with helping Solstice platoon with ideas. Squad origins are being worked on in Solstice Platoon. (Origin stories are the backgrounds for each squad. Story telling essentially. Squad logos as well.) Dawn has new PCO in Clax.

### PC Console Commander Report
PC is fine. (55 new members, but not all retained). Dealing with small issues across the console. Shatter is working with Tuut on some certain issues. Stomping down on inactivty.

### Horizon Company Report
Igneel is on LOA.
As of April 16, 2025, Iridium Platoon continues to perform well, even as school schedules begin to complicate attendance. Throughout the month, the platoon has been running a large-scale event called Project Brick. While this has led to a slight drop in raid attendance due to focus shifting to events and other games, it has also significantly increased activity in community voice chats and strengthened internal relations. A new, clearly defined Staff Hosting policy has been implemented, requiring staff to host regularly or receive strikes. This policy is consistent with changes across the broader PC structure. So far, only SGT Bacara has received a strike for not meeting hosting requirements. Although his general staff work has increased, his attendance and hosting have not improved, and his performance will continue to be monitored. Squad Hadron has experienced some difficulty following Lurk's resignation. ASGT Krei has been assigned to assist the squad. While there are no major results to report yet, the squad has recently held a meeting to address communication gaps and inactivity. Further updates on their progress will be provided soon.

### Vanguard Company Report:
Platoon activity in Vanguard remains steady. Is noted that attendance is down over the last period, multiple reasons brought forward in regards to this (Exam times for university/college students, hacked lobbies during period, members on medical NFFC/LOA).  Otherwise good activity with some positive growth (new squad built in Spectre Platoon, ACG training in all platoons)
Vanguard Company continues to host bi weekly company command meetings every second Monday. Generally held at 1600hrs EST. Attendance for the same has been consistent.
Cadet Training has been steady. Some cadets have been purged from the program based on lack of attempts to complete cadet training as well as lack of response to numerous messages about same
Members have begun planning multiple platoon and company wide events for members in order to continue active and position engagement in the 104th
The Company Training team has been working to ensure staff members are up to date in new roles. No pending tasks for same.

## Major of Discord Staff Training Report:
I have been working on ideas for what will be a unit wide training program. We will be making set standards for getting prompted, LCPL-SGT will have certain points of knowledge they will need to know prior to promotions. We have written up some things they will ned to know, that effort has been put on hold as well are currently conducting interviews to see how staff training is being done right now. We are almost done with PC and will move to Xbox. We are also working on a website that will be an formation site and have certification tests as way we ca know that people know how to handle things the right way. I have also been working on some changes and rework to the CNCO role and using it, PS4 has 2 and they really help develop the role.
